This section details the experiments conducted on the trained models created during this thesis project. Each section will focus on a specific loss method, detailed in @tab:loss-combinations. Within each of these sections, both qualitative and quantitative results will be presented. The qualitative results will be illustrated with images generated by the models. The models' weights will be instantiated with the saved weights from different training epochs, picked from the sets $S_"epochs"$ in @tab:loss-combinations. The quantitative results will be in the form of training and validation graphs, showing the evolution of the loss and accuracy as the models' training progressed. This approach to showing the results is chosen to provide a clear and concise overview of the models' performance, both in terms of their ability to learn the task and their generalization capabilities, through glimpses into the results generated at varying but comparative stages of training.

The images used for the qualitative results were chosen from the validation set. The two chosen images present different scenes and thus offer different challenges to the models. The first image is of a simple intersection, with two roads intersecting perpendicularly, but with turn lanes and slightly curvy roads. The second image is of an intersection where the intersect between the two roads is not perpendicular and there are a fair amount of clear road markings.

Finally, as will be evident from the training and validation graphs, the models trained shows clears signs of overfitting. Therefore, a result of giving the models an image from the training dataset will be shown as well. This is to illustrate the models' ability to eventually learn the task, given large enough datasets and training time.

All experiments were conducted on the same hardware. The desktop features an Intel Core i7-9700K CPU, 16GB DIMM DDR5 RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 GPU with 4GB VRAM. All data was stored on an NVMe M.2 SSD, with the model checkpoints being saved to a SATA HDD. The environment on the desktop is Windows 11 Pro, utilizing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) running the Linux distribution Ubuntu 24.04. Although the computational capabilities of the machine should not influence the results for this specific experimental setup if replicated, it should be noted that larger systems allow for larger and more complex models, as well as larger batches of data to be processed at once, likely achieving better results.
