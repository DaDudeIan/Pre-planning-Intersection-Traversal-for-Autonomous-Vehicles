== Model Design <c4:model>

// ResNet-bassed CNN + U-Net
// Diffusion-based models
// Fully convolutional networks
// Vision Transformers




// Other considerations:
// - RL (no, because of added complexity)
// While reinforcement learning has its merits in sequential decision-making tasks, it typically requires a different setupâ€”defining a reward function, handling exploration, and dealing with potentially unstable training dynamics. For generating paths (which is more of a structured prediction or segmentation problem), RL might add unnecessary complexity without clear benefits over the more straightforward supervised or generative approaches.
