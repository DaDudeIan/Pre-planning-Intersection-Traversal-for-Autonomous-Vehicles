= Methodology <methodology>


This section covers the methodology and work produced as part of the thesis...

// Where ambiguities arise, explanations or arguments for the chosen interpretations are provided.

// Where behaviour is not self evident, and not described in both the paper@gbpplanner and the source code@gbpplanner-code a point will be made with a clear reference to the source from which the knowledge was derived from.



// No communication exchange has been made with the authors

// #todo[
//   Talk about the reproduction aspects, what methodologies have we used to reproduce the paper?
// ]


// #jonas[This section is more WIP than background, as not everything is here yet. However the overall structure and content layout it here, so do not spend too much time going too deep into the details. Just look more at the flow of information.]

// #jonas[The hypothesis 1 and 4 and study 1 and 4 have been merged]
